Recreation of the Breathe animation of WatchOS

The challenge was to do this in 1 hour.
Wanted to do more like the start of the animation and cleaning up the code.
The shrinking part also isn't perfect, but time ran out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

We could also choose any framework or method to build it.
I went for SpriteKit, because why not.
